# Stock_Data_Scraper
This script was created using beautifulsoup4 a Python web scraping library and the requests library. The purpose of the project was to get the stock price data, such as the current price and daily increase or decrease percentage. The data originates from Yahoo Finance. 

When running the code, the user will be prompted with the question, "What stock would you like to look up?" to which the ticker symbol of the desired stock should be replied. Once this has been followed, the price, daily increase or decrease, and the daily percent change in listed order.
